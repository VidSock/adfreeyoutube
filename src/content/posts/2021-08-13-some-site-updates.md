First, thank you for visiting AdFree! 

We are actively working to make this the best experience for those who hate clicking skip ads on YouTube. \
\
Today we have rolled out a new Full Screen option that is available site-wide. Now you can view stuff in all it’s large glory!

We’ve also implemented a new Install Process for our PWA (progressive web app). It’s now much easier to view the install prompt. We’ve also set things up, so that when you have the web app installed, your will no longer see the install prompts.

If you see anything out of whack or are experiencing problems in any way, please use the “contact” link in the menu to let us know right away.



Thanks again for enjoying AdFree!
