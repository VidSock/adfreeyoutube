## (Now) Ex-Mayor Cuomo announces post-retirement plans to invest in a chain of restaurants.

Mayor Cuomo announced his retirement and his future plans to open a chain of what he is calling "breastaurants", which will "cater to folks who want great food with a great view". 

The new chain affectionately called Touchie's, will strive to live by it's motto: "if you don't want to be touchied, don't come to Touchies". 

Cuomo hopes to have the Grand Opening in the Fall with two locations on the Upper West Side. 

The Mayor was unavailable for any further comments.
